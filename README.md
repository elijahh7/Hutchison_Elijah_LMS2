# Hutchison_Elijah_LMS2
Software Implementation Phase 1 for CEN 3024C

This is the second version of my LMS. This version contains three classes: the main, books, and library. This version is intended to scan in a user file containing books
with the property's barcode number and title. Once the user's file is successfully scanned in they will receive confirmation and be prompted with a menu of actions they can perform.
These include removing a book using the barcode number, removing a book using its title, checking out a book, checking in a book, displaying the library contents, as well as exiting the program. Each method has proper exception handling to inform the user if they are incorrectly entering information or if an action has already been performed. I also tried to do as much as possible in my classes to reduce excessive code in my main.
